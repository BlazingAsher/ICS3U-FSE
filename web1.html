    <p id="p1">For our Grade 11 Computer Science FSE, we decided to make something for the good of the people. No matter
        what software you use to have files over a network, it's never 100 percent what you want it to be. That's where our
        project comes in. We made a file indexer that would search through all computers that are on the same account, and
        will show them whenever you need it. Boom, no backups or updates needed.
